It looks like I found a friend in Josh - a young j-school student who’s just interviewed me regarding *Extratone* for a profile assignment, which he apparently intends to follow up on. One who understands and responds to my infinite media industry-related conjecture, which is cherishable in and of itself. I’m rather amused at the thought of journalism professors reading/hearing about my *ideological* and *naive* undertaking. 

It’s doubtful much more will be done for the site, this month, but the rest I’ve gotten spending time with Eryn will prove beneficiary, I think. I did write [Lacky Sleaze](http://bit.ly/smutsleaze) in general frustration with Columbia and the people my age (men, mostly) who seem to *literally* & *obviously* want nothing but to fuck. We’ve also been going pretty hard on [Anchor](http://extratone.com/anchor) - [added](https://www.periscope.tv/AsphaltApostle/1OdKrygYYvVxX?t=50m41s) to [her song](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/sultry) on a more substantial instrument than my upright or keyboard for a while, and we finally managed to sneak into the music school to find a practice room with two identical Yamaha uprights. It’s important for me to play when sleep deprived (hence that one time I actually [fell asleep](https://soundcloud.com/digivoid/asleep)  on tape and continued to play.) As I understand it, the brain is less and less able to determine what is and is not relevant information. If I add adderall to the mix, I get much more eloquent (often pretentious) in everything I do - - it allows me to *find* more when I’m *searching*, if that makes any sense. My interactions involve both conscious and unconscious decisions, but they’re better when the latter is as great ‘

My ‘performance’ itself was adequate - I think I accomplished what I went to do - but the highlight of the experience began when Eryn started playing around. She just started rhythmically pressing different keys in exactly the same way I first did as a toddler. For whatever reason, I’ve never actually had the opportunity to improvise/add around somebody playing this way, and it was  ‘teach’ my nieces and nephews how to play, and the method I briefly tried with Eryn is the only one I’d apply ( ‘lessons’ is whether or not the potential student *actually wants* to learn, and it’s answer is found in how he/she/they behave when they’re sat in front of an instrument. If their fingers are not drawn to the keys - even after a wait, and/or some time left alone with it, perhaps - there’s not much to be done. If you *actually* want somebody to “ [Listen](http://bit.ly/referencetradition) - it’s those few who observe my relationship with longing (like the subject of the poem,) that need(ed) to be told, perhaps.

Anyway. Playing with Eryn was a real joy - I’ve never been able to share my relationship with the piano that way, before.

In other petty news, Nevermore is officially Out Of Action after its starter solenoid stuck, causing it to run constantly no matter what I did - even without the key in the ignition - until it burned the motor out. As much as I love my car, the funds needed to get it back to Proper Working Order - now some $3000, at least - are not within a reasonable savings goal in the foreseeable future, especially considering my [plan](http://bit.ly/freq10) *do not* have that *thing* that makes mechanics/technicians exceptional at figuring out how to fix most anything. It’s one of those incommunicable-but-immediately-apparent aspects of life. On my farm, I did have experience rebuilding/restoring a 1948 Ford 8N - the subject of [To My Little Tractor](http://bit.ly/feeblespdf) - but uh… things have changed, for one. I don’t have much option, though - *Ricky* jeans and hope the endeavor will fit well with my recent [snap](https://youtu.be/pmrVPelvhRo). 

I have continued my experimentation with Mary Jane, thanks to Eryn’s company, and was able to get a few fairly-humorous observations down while high. (No, it is not cannabis journalism, though [this story](https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/high-times-legalization-news.php) did remind me of its existence, notably.) 

*I remember shapes of the things in the hallway? in between the garage and the house. I think I remember a specific smell and image of Grandpa's minivan. I see*  *"*  *-* *the shower and the phones? I obsessively swept the restroom area.*  *(* *It was not a building*  *-*  *(* *That's something BMIs may be sophisticated enough to archive for me before I die.)*

I wish it was easier to retain memories of the sensation, but - as I’m sure you know - those side-effects dealing with memory, itself, are incredibly difficult to capture. It’d also be nice to retain… anything, really. I [favorite listicle of all time](http://antiquetractorblog.com/2015/05/25/why-i-love-the-8n-ford/) searching for images of the 8N to include. Is this [young woman](https://twitter.com/RachelGingell) who blogs about tractors the Long Lost Love I have been searching for? 

The career, of course, not the individual. If  *combine outside of Eryn’s hometown.*

Until next time,
David
