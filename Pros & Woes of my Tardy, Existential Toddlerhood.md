# Pros & Woes of my Tardy, Existential Toddlerhood
> *I am feeling discouraged and stressed, but that's okay.*  

Well... that's all I was compelled to write, sober.

Yes, I'm still thinking about  *why*  I am doing this whole thing, and maybe that's unhealthy. Perhaps I'm blind to my own misdirections, but I've stubbornly retained the belief that I can think and talk my way through everything. The practice (especially when public, like this) is consistently cyclical. If existing as a witness to one who's constantly repeating themselves is as excruciating as I've always found it to be, I apologize. But - as I've mentioned publicly a few times these past few months - it would appear that repeating myself (within reason) actually nets positive in terms of distribution of my conversation.

> *My conversation.*  

That's an extraordinarily lucky segue into the other prime component of my recent internal discussions:  ***what do I really have to say?** * and precisely  **why**, **where**, and **how**? 

A year ago (to the day, nearly,) Brent and I semi-ironically watched a bunch of Disney movies from our childhood, and I wrote *the very first* and second works for  *Extratone*, entitled "[Stairs, Wiggling](http://bit.ly/wigglecruise)," and "[Johnny Tsunami 6: Separate, But Equal](http://bit.ly/sarahmouth)," respectively.

I think it's possible that they are also the first and second most  *entertaining*  compositions I'll ever birth, but it's interesting, in retrospect - even in the midst of some very taunt bitterness - my newfound commitment to incubating my emotional functionality was evident in the way I spoke of  *Furious 7*. It's relevant to myself and my own personal development, which, clearly, is our primary beat, to this day.

And I'd spent 2015 saying some truly hilarious shit on *Drycast*,  *Honk*, and the off-record conversations I had with Brent, in between, but I'd been under the influence  ***the entire time**.* During the making of [my Toyota Avalon review](http://bit.ly/selfavalon) - debatably  *Honk*'s peak - I was high on adderall, alcohol, and some  *very*  good cocaine. Brent and I truly became our own, ultra-bitter, highly-exclusive society of  *hatred*  and maniacal, recklessly loathsome irreverence. I was sharp, witty, and ***utterly miserable***. By early Winter, my grief was  *really*  gaining ground on me. After hyper-focusing for a month and half getting [Feebles](http://bit.ly/Feebles)  to print, I ran out of distractions. By late Spring, I'd lost my job and escaped as completely as I could into  *Eve Online.*

And then - in June - I met Eryn, who'd lead me back to Earth, teaching and changing me far more than anyone I've ever encountered.

But that's a story for another time.

I wrote and said a lot in 2015, and most of it's pretty sublime, by my standards, but also  *entirely useless. Drycast* was hilarious, yes, but my then-primary means of hysterical spewing really just served up a realization: while some of my arguments were very entertaining and intelligent,  *none*  were  ***relevant***. I'm thankful I managed to be as receptive as I was to the new perspectives from friends old & new that were graciously presented to me while hosting that show, but after it'd spun out, I found myself lamenting the opportunities I'd missed in consistently sacrificing any real depth to the idol of  *entertainment*. 

I'm pretty convinced that those few months between the [last episode of old Drycast](http://bit.ly/drycast54)  and  *Extratone*'s founding were the worst I will ever experience, mostly because I perceived my future as in *absolute zero* status *.* It was utterly silent, wholly peaceful, and... identical to death, really.

(I recently said something like "*Feebles*  was my critique of peace, and  *Extratone*  is my manifesto against it," but it's also a means of finding and providing an **alternative**, in many ways.)

In the midst, of course, I put many 'a' manhour into  *my own poetry collection*, feeding my obsession with revision with a boatload of adderall to a degree that I forgot to continue drinking alcohol. By the time I figured out what the hell my withdrawals were, I thought I'd just hold out the rest of the way to sobriety, leaving myself with my fairly rudimentary publication, and an empty schedule. And it was on Amazon, there, yet I could not sincerely find it within myself to recommend it to potential customers over Rupi Kaur. I missed my tractors and found peculiarity in my waking post-mortem drear, and  *so fucking what*.

I can't give you a specific date, but something very profound happened, then, while I was left alone in silence with my exponentially growing fear of death: I realized that **the legacy of an amplifier and shepherd of *relevant* voices was vastly more preferable to one consisting of my voice, alone.**

In my waywardness, I'd been allowing myself my first opportunities to truly recommune with my punk friends from high school, without my blinding adolescent distractions, and I extrapolated from  *Feebles*  'silence(peace) = nothing but death' argument, determining  *I'm here, and I want to fucking live*, which simply meant existing in the antithesis of death... **NOISE.**

For the first time since Junior High, I began to explore the prospect of *Web Development*. The name 'Extratone' was first or second on my list. The Twitter username was free, and the dot com was up for auction. I won it in early April, and the year, since has unquestionably been  **the most significant of my entire life**, to date.

*Thanks, WordPress...........*

In sincerity, though, I must (continuously) thank  **you**. If you're still reading, you're more likely than not one of the primary reasons I am still here.  Heavy stuff, eh? Till next time, 

David

*The Pitch: Dirty, Digital, Defective?*

They like [making up their own datapoints](https://youtu.be/bNpx7gpSqbY) to plug in rudimentary stat formulas in order to produce colorful graphics to show to identical audiences who surely would not be present and participatory without some kind of stimulant in their system.

I am particularly vulnerable to the sort of abstract thinking institutions like TED pervade, which is why I have always been very way of them. Yesterday, I said something insightful of myself to my friend Tevin:

> "I'm great at identifying problems, but am utterly inept at coming up with solutions, which is why I am a writer."  

In past projects, my failure has over and over been in an overemphasis on ideas, and a deficit of attention to any tangible product. I write my ed's letters in an ultra-meta perspective in the hope that I'll be able to keep myself in check until I'm able to build a salaried editorial team around me. It's also why I have been killing myself polishing both my own words and the look of the site, itself. I want to be sure that - when the opportunity arises to present *Extratone* to investors - I have a liberal surplus of ***product*** to depend on. 

I have spent the past few months riding a day-to-day pendulum between  *I am insane*  and  *I am a genius*  in ever more precarious angles, which you can consider *pro-health*  in my case, I think. I'm just now realizing a use for that  *passion*  word in my life, though my rate of progress is not exactly blistering. While I am now Verified Invested emotionally in  *Extratone*, I exist at an inadequate emotional intelligence - in many areas - to handle the consequences of such an investment appropriately. But again...  **this is a good thing**. Though I suppose I couldn't have chosen to improve myself in a single more public (not necessarily  *popular* ) means.

*Please get me the fuck out of here.*

Tevin and I talked about this on what's probably the best [episode](http://extratone.com/futureland/hater) of  *Futureland*  to date. Our childhoods were both particularly notable examples of the  *you can be anything you want to be* generation. I inexplicably began recording things as early as toddlerhood, and he began playing around with video in his fifth grade. Neither of us ever quit, really, so we both have a difficult-to-manifest body of skills that we acquired in the pursuit of a final product, or by *a whole lotta fuckin around.* 

Now, we are both trying to make careers out of our happenstance proficiencies. Apparently, Tevin makes  *some*  money freelance video editing, but he's also a competitive gamer. A good one. He was 13th in the world for Mortal Kombat 9, and he's still very keen on getting good, but remains acutely aware of the reality of it all. Perhaps it's because he grew up black in a Kansas working class home. 

I've spent the entirety of my adulthood 'joking' about my ambition and moneymaking, but I've ended up a bit Marxist in day-to-day life, if I'm honest. That said, there's one quote from the girl I used to infiltrate Amway (that's uh... a story that'll still have to wait a bit) that's continued to seem more and more insightful.

> You can't help anybody without any money.  

I have a lot to offer, but it's almost never needed more than just... cash. I suspect a big reason Extratone's patreon hasn't been more successful is that my friends & audience are mostly 'creatives' and therefore very broke, always. I think we're all capable of being a worthwhile investment for the general public, but I haven't been able to articulate  *why*  in a manner they can understand. (Which is one of the reasons I'm writing these.) 

Of course, the second I started publicly using the word  *startup*, my YouTube recommendations became ridiculous. I complied with one video, yesterday, and was surprised to hear [something personally relatable](https://youtu.be/toVTP-vcsk8?t=18m35s) (if vague) from Stevie Jobs.

> ...to know that you can plant something in the world, and it'll grow...  

Always with the agricultural metaphors.
I've never been a big fan of the *The Fruit Man*, but I feel like I understand him, now, for better or worse. It's strange to be using the same language I've heard from the looniest individuals I've encountered so far in life. Most of them also consider(ed) themselves unique, but really... aren't. Not that the uniqueness of a body matters, just that of what it says,; and I still think my comrades and I have something worthwhile, in that regard. 

This is the essence of the divide I have been repeatedly teetering across, as of late: I *really am* a human being, and I love them, but I am also  *definitely*  strange, and find communicating with them to be frustrating, at times. My religion has always been **aspiration**, though I did know it by name when I was powerless and required to inhabit other churches, as a child. As I've gotten older, I've grown to understand its interdependence with **curiosity**, and have become especially committed to keeping both alive in myself those whom I care about for as long as I can. After 2015's crises and subsequent alcoholism, I've resolved in this commitment a sort of purpose in life.

*Click this bullshit to hear an especially creative track from my latest tape,* Four.

I've been playing the piano *a lot* recently, and even began a Big Ole' Post for the site, detailing my now 20-year-long relationship with *The Dear Chordophone*. Naturally, there's been internal debate as to whether or not it belongs on  *Extratone*. Coincidentally or not, the story is in keeping with what we've planned for *Summer Edition*. (It involves boys & trauma.) As saturated as I've become with sincerity, it's still a little cringey to imagine such self-indulgence appearing immediately after I've begun soliciting for subscribers. Here's an early preview.

Let me know if it's too genuine to survive. (You can actually reply to these emails, which is pretty handy.) I now have 60mg of Adderall left until the 30th, which should make for one more productive day. I guess we'll see if I'll be compelled to write one of these without it. Till next time,
